    <p>Stuffed Shells are an Italian-American pasta dish featuring jumbo shells stuffed with a ricotta filling and covered with sauce. 
        Popular fillings for stuffed shells are Three-Cheese, Spinach and Cheese, and of course, 
        Stuffed Shells with Meat!</p>
    <p>They are typically topped off with marinara sauce, 
       although a homemade alfredo sauce wouldnâ€™t be half bad either. </p>
